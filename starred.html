<p>Cramâ€™s rule was an attempt to explain how different values for this quantity arise for two stereoisomeric products from an asymmetric starting material, and it was later improved upon by the Felkin-Anh model. Work by Hudlicky and coworkers has identified a trend of inflation in reported values for this quantity in recent decades. For a batch or continuous chemical process, this quantity is the conversion multiplied by the selectivity of the reaction. This quantity is described using words including â€˜goodâ€™, â€˜excellentâ€™, and â€˜quantitativeâ€™ in increasing order, and it is always lowered during purification steps.
